# concurrency
During 5th semester I completed 'The theory of concurrency' classes.
In folder [Sprawozdania](https://github.com/kbieniasz/concurrency/tree/master/Sprawozdania) there are exaustive reports from each exercise.
Realised subjects:
* common concurrency problems such as producents-consuments or dining philosophers
* Java Concurrency Utilities
* Active Object pattern
* Communicating sequential processes and JCSP package
* Foata form
* Petri nets
